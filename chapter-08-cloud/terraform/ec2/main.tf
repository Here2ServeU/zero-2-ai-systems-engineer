# EC2 stack: one root, three environments (dev, qa, prod).
#
# This file is intentionally thin. Every real resource lives in a module under
# ../modules/; the root just wires them together and sets the tags.
#
# The backend settings are NOT written here. They come from
# environments/<env>.tfbackend plus the bucket name at `terraform init` time,
# so the same code writes dev, qa and prod to separate state files:
#   s3://<bucket>/ec2/dev/terraform.tfstate
#   s3://<bucket>/ec2/qa/terraform.tfstate
#   s3://<bucket>/ec2/prod/terraform.tfstate
